# Purpose: Practice using if, elif, and else statments.
# Usage: ./lab2c.py

# TO DO 1:
# Prmopt the user to enter a sentence, save it in the variable str1
# Prmopt the user to enter another sentence, save it in the variable str2
#
# Use if, elif, and else statments with the len() function to check which of the 2 is longer.
# The final result should be:
# ---- is longer then ----
# If they are equal then print:
# ---- and ---- are equal.
# Get input from the user



str1 = input("Enter a sentence: ")
str2 = input("Enter another sentence: ")

if len(str1) > len(str2):
    print(f"{str1} is longer then {str2}!")
elif len(str2) > len(str1):
    print(f"{str2} is longer then {str1}!")
else:
    print(f"{str1} and {str2} are of equal length!")
