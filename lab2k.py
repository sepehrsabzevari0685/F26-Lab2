fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]

# Use a for loop to iterate over the list
#for fruit in fruits:
#    print(fruit)

#for loop is commonly used with range functions. Here's another example using the range function to print numbers from 0  to 5.



total = 0

for number in range(1, 101):
    if number % 2 == 0:
        total = total + number

print(total)
