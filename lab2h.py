# Purpose: Learn how to use while loops.
# Usage: ./lab2h.py

# TO DO 1: 
# Creat variable timer.
# The value of timer should initially be 10.
# Use a while loop to create program that counts down from 10 with timer to 1.
# When you reach 1 end the loop and print blast off!

timer = 10

while timer >= 1:
    print(timer)
    timer = timer - 1

print("Blast off!")
